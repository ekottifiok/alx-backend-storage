    Write a Python script that provides some stats about Nginx logs stored in MongoDB:

    Database: logs
    Collection: nginx
    Display (same as the example):
    first line: x logs where x is the number of documents in this collection
    second line: Methods:
    5 lines with the number of documents with the method = ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "PATCH", "DELETE"] in this order (see example below - warning: itâ€™s a tabulation before each line)
    one line with the number of documents with:
